## Ad Copy Framework (Use This Template)

### Formula for Honest Headlines (<50 chars)

**Pattern 1: "Chat/Text + Character/Story"**
- "Chat with Lady Verlaine. Save her from death" (48)
- "Text the regressor. Rewrite the ending" (42)
- "Chat your way out. You're the villainess" (44)

**Pattern 2: "Platform Comparison"**
- "Like Character.AI for romance stories" (41)
- "Wattpad meets texting. You're in control" (44)
- "Interactive chat fiction. Your choices win" (46)

**Pattern 3: "Format + Hook"**
- "Text-based isekai. You know the plot" (40)
- "Chat to survive. 17 days left" (33)
- "Message-based romance. Change the ending" (44)

### Key Phrases to Include in Body

**Must include ONE of these** to set expectations:
- ✅ "Chat with characters"
- ✅ "Text-based interactive"
- ✅ "Like texting [character]"
- ✅ "Message-based story"
- ✅ "Interactive fiction through chat"

**Comparison anchors** (help users understand):
- "Like Character.AI but..."
- "Think [known thing] meets [known thing]"
- "Wattpad meets messaging"
- "Choose Your Own Adventure via text"

- ❌ "Visual novel" (implies graphics)
- ❌ Don't show only artwork without showing chat UI

## CTA Hierarchy (Best to Worst)

### Honest CTAs (Use These)
1. ✅ **"Start Chat"** - Clear expectation
2. ✅ **"Chat Now"** - Clear + urgent
3. ✅ **"Try Free"** - Neutral, honest
4. ✅ **"Start Story"** - Acceptable, less specific

### Misleading CTAs (Avoid)
5. ⚠️ **"Start Chatting"** - OK but wordy
6. ❌ **"Play Now"** - Suggests game/visual novel
7. ❌ **"Play Free"** - Suggests game
8. ❌ **"Learn More"** - Too passive (but honest)

**Recommendation**: Use **"Start Chat"** for all campaigns.

## Visual Creative Recommendations

### Current Issue
**Problem**: Beautiful fantasy artwork looks like a visual novel game.

### Solution 1: Show Chat Interface (Recommended)
**Image**: Screenshot of actual chat interface with:
- Character avatar
- Message bubbles
- Choice buttons visible
- Background image

**Why**: Sets immediate expectation of what the product is.

### Solution 2: Split Creative
**Image**:
- Left 40%: Character portrait
- Right 60%: Chat interface mockup with messages

**Why**: Shows both the story content AND the format.

### Solution 3: Text Overlay on Artwork
**Image**: Keep beautiful artwork BUT add overlay text:
- "📱 Chat-based Interactive Fiction"
- "Your choices via text messages"

**Why**: Keeps scroll-stopping creative while setting expectations.

## A/B Test Plan

### Test 1: Honest vs Vague Headlines
