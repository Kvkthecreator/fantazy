## Executive Summary

Three-tier channel strategy optimized for interactive romance fiction:

| Tier | Platforms | Strategy | Goal |
|------|-----------|----------|------|
| **Broadcast** | Twitter/X | Paid ads, broad targeting | Awareness, creative testing |
| **Organic** | TikTok, Instagram | Content posting, no paid | Engagement, brand personality |
| **Community** | Reddit, Tumblr | Targeted ads + native participation | High-intent conversion |

**One-liner**: "Broadcast on Twitter, Organic on TikTok/IG, Community on Reddit/Tumblr"

---

## Tier 1: Broadcast (Twitter/X)

### Purpose
Mass awareness and creative testing. Twitter has:
- Low CPMs relative to other platforms
- Tolerance for romance content
- Decent targeting options
- Fast iteration cycle for A/B testing

### Strategy
- **Paid ads** with broad targeting
- **Mass appeal hooks** and scroll-stopping visuals
- **A/B test** copy, images, and CTAs aggressively
- Use learnings to inform other channels

### Do
- Test multiple creatives simultaneously
- Use strong character visuals (K-pop idol, CEO, etc.)
- Iterate fast based on CTR/CPC data
- Target interest-based audiences (romance, K-drama, fanfic)

### Don't
- Over-target niche audiences (use broad)
- Run single creative for too long
- Expect community engagement (it's broadcast)

### Recommended Ad Units

#### Ad #1: Midnight Burn (K-Pop Idol)
| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Image** | K-pop idol character, moody lighting, direct gaze |
| **Copy** | "He's not just on your screen anymore." |
| **Headline** | "Step into the story. Make your choice." |
| **Target** | K-pop fans, K-drama watchers, romance readers |

#### Ad #2: Corner Office (CEO Romance)
| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Image** | Ethan character - suit, city lights, intense gaze |
| **Copy** | "Everyone warned you about him. Burns through assistants. No small talk. But you keep catching moments he doesn't mean to show." |
| **Headline** | "The walls he built weren't meant to keep you out." |
| **Target** | Romance readers, BookTok, Wattpad users |

#### Ad #3: The Arrangement (Fake Dating)
| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Image** | Two silhouettes close, warm lighting, intimate framing |
| **Copy** | "The arrangement was simple: pretend in public, strangers in private. But they're too good at this." |
| **Headline** | "Pretend long enough and the lie becomes the truth." |
| **Target** | Fanfic readers, AO3 users, trope lovers |

---

## Tier 2: Organic (TikTok, Instagram)

### Purpose
Build brand personality and engagement without paid spend. These platforms have:
- High reach potential for good content
- Strong romance/fanfic communities
- Risk of shadowbans for romance ads (hence organic only)

### Strategy
- **Post content**, don't pay for ads
- **Behind-the-scenes**, trope humor, character reveals
- **Short video** format optimized for each platform
- **Lean into trends** and sounds

### Content Types
| Type | Description | Frequency |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| Character reveals | Introduce characters with dramatic/romantic framing | 2x/week |
| Trope humor | "When the fake dating gets too real" type content | 3x/week |
| Behind-the-scenes | How we create stories, character design | 1x/week |
| User reactions | Reshare/react to user content | As available |
| Trend participation | Jump on relevant sounds/formats | Opportunistic |

### Do
- Post consistently (minimum 3x/week)
- Use trending sounds and formats
- Show personality, be human
- Engage in comments
- Cross-post between TikTok and IG Reels

### Don't
- Pay for ads (high risk of flags/bans)
- Sound like a brand
- Post only promotional content
- Ignore comments/engagement

---

## Tier 3: Community (Reddit, Tumblr)

### Purpose
Reach high-intent users in niche communities. These platforms have:
- Highly engaged fanfic/romance communities
- Low CPMs (especially Tumblr)
- Strong targeting by subreddit/tags
- Users who actively seek this type of content

### Strategy
- **Targeted ads** to specific communities
- **Native participation** first, promotion second
- **Speak the language** of each community
- **Build presence** before selling

### Target Communities

#### Reddit
| Subreddit | Size | Relevance | Notes |
|-----------|------|-----------|-------|
| r/RomanceBooks | 200k+ | High | Active readers seeking new content |
| r/FanFiction | 300k+ | High | Writers and readers, trope-aware |
| r/otomegames | 100k+ | Very High | Interactive romance enthusiasts |
| r/kdrama | 400k+ | High | K-content fans, crossover potential |
| r/ChoicesVIP | 50k+ | Very High | Choices/interactive fiction players |

#### Tumblr
| Tag/Community | Relevance | Notes |
|---------------|-----------|-------|
| #fanfiction | Very High | Core audience |
| #romance tropes | Very High | Trope-aware readers |
| #kpop | High | K-content crossover |
| #interactive fiction | High | Direct category match |
| #enemies to lovers | High | Specific trope targeting |

### Do
- Participate genuinely before promoting
- Use native ad formats (promoted posts)
- Match the tone of each community
- Respond to comments and questions
- Use proper tags (Tumblr) and flair (Reddit)

### Don't
- Drop links without context (you'll get banned)
- Sound corporate or salesy
- Ignore community rules
- Spam multiple subreddits simultaneously

### Community-Specific Copy

**Reddit** (more direct, informational):
> "Built an interactive fiction platform for romance readers. You chat with characters and shape the story. Genres include K-drama romance, CEO slow burn, fake dating. Free to try. Would love feedback from this community."

**Tumblr** (more casual, enthusiastic):
> "ok so i've been working on this thing where you literally text with romance characters and make choices that change the story?? we have enemies to lovers, fake dating, the whole deal. it's free. someone please validate my life choices."

---

## Landing Page Strategy: Series-Specific URLs

> **CRITICAL FOR ALL CAMPAIGNS**: Always link to series-specific pages, NOT the generic homepage.

### URL Structure

**Format**: `https://ep-0.com/series/[series-slug]`

**Examples**:
- `https://ep-0.com/series/the-villainess-survives`
- `https://ep-0.com/series/midnight-burn`
- `https://ep-0.com/series/corner-office`
- `https://ep-0.com/series/death-flag-deleted`

### Why Series-Specific Landing Pages

| Issue | Generic Homepage | Series-Specific Page |
|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Message match | ❌ Ad says "Lady Verlaine", landing is generic | ✅ Same visuals, character, story |
| User intent | ❌ "Where's the story I clicked on?" | ✅ Immediate relevance |
| Bounce rate | ❌ 89% (measured) | ✅ 40-50% (projected) |
| Signup rate | ❌ 2.7% (measured) | ✅ 8-12% (projected) |
| Decision paralysis | ❌ Browse entire catalog | ✅ Clear CTA: "Start Episode 0" |

### Series Page Features

All `/series/[slug]` pages include:
- ✅ **Public access** (no login required to view)
- ✅ Series hero image, genre, tagline
- ✅ Episode list with descriptions and thumbnails
- ✅ "Start Episode 0 Free" CTA (prompts signup on click)
- ✅ Progress tracking (for returning users)
- ✅ Character selection (if custom characters exist)

### Implementation Details

**Authentication flow**:
1. User clicks TikTok/Reddit ad → lands on `/series/[slug]` (no login)
2. User sees series info, episodes, and "Start Episode" buttons
3. Click "Start Episode" → Signup modal appears
4. After signup → User is redirected directly to episode chat
5. Series page remembers their progress for future visits

**For Ad Campaigns**:
- Otome Isekai campaign → `ep-0.com/series/the-villainess-survives`
- Manhwa Regressor campaign → `ep-0.com/series/death-flag-deleted`
- K-pop Idol campaign → `ep-0.com/series/midnight-burn`
- CEO Romance campaign → `ep-0.com/series/corner-office`

### Finding Series Slugs

**To get the slug for a series**:
1. Go to `/discover` page (when logged in)
2. Click any series card
3. URL will show the slug: `/series/[this-is-the-slug]`

**OR** via API:
```bash
curl https://api.ep-0.com/series?status=active
```

Look for the `slug` field in each series object.

### Generic Homepage Usage

**Use `ep-0.com` (homepage) ONLY for**:
- Brand awareness campaigns (no specific series)
- Press mentions
- Direct navigation (users typing URL)
- Generic social media bios

**For all series-specific content** (ads, TikTok videos, Reddit posts):
→ **Always use series-specific URLs**
