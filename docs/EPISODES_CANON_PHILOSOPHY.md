## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document defines **how episodes work in Fantazy** — not how they are written, but **why they exist, how they progress, and how they create value**.

It establishes:

- Episodes as the *primary engagement unit*
- Sequential progression as the *core retention mechanic*
- Narrative gating as *intentional design*, not limitation

This canon supersedes any prior assumptions about episodes as “optional scenarios” or “free selections.”

---

## 2. Core Principle (Non-Negotiable)

> Episodes are earned narrative moments, not content to browse.
> 

Fantazy is an **interactive episodic experience platform**, not:

- a chat sandbox
- a companion simulator
- a scenario library

Progression, anticipation, and emotional escalation are the product.

---

## 3. What an Episode Is (Definition)

An **Episode** is:

> A self-contained, high-tension narrative moment that advances the emotional relationship between the user and a character.
> 

Each episode:

- begins *in media res* (already happening)
- introduces or escalates emotional stakes
- has narrative gravity (it wants to go somewhere)
- leaves the user wanting what comes next

Episodes are **not**:

- backstory dumps
- generic roleplay prompts
- interchangeable fantasies

---

## 4. Episode Progression Model (Canonical)

Fantazy uses a **Soft-Sequential Progression Model**.

### High-Level Structure

```
Episode0 →Episode1 →Episode2 →Episode3 → …
      │
      └── (Optional: Side / Special Episodes)

```

Progression is **sequential by default**, with controlled flexibility.

---

## 5. Episode Types

### 5.1 Episode 0 — The Entry Episode (Pilot)

**Purpose**

- First impression
- Emotional hook
- Fantasy framing

**Rules**

- Always accessible
- One per character
- Optimized for cold-start attraction
- Appears in Discover surfaces

**Design Mandate**

Episode 0 must answer, within 30 seconds:

- Who is this?
- Where am I?
- Why is this moment charged?
- Why should I reply *now*?

Episode 0 is not the shallowest episode — it is the **sharpest hook**.

---

### 5.2 Core Episodes (Episode 1–N)

**Purpose**

- Relationship progression
- Escalation of tension, vulnerability, or stakes
- Narrative payoff over time

**Rules**

- Sequentially unlocked
- Must be experienced in order
- Each episode *changes the relationship state*

**Unlock Philosophy**

Unlocking is based on **engagement**, not grind:

- meaningful interaction
- time spent
- emotional signals
- narrative participation

Not message counts. Not chores.

---

### 5.3 Expansion Episodes (Optional, Later)

**Purpose**

- Deepen attachment
- Explore alternate emotional facets
- Reward long-term engagement

**Characteristics**

- Conditional unlock
- May explore:
    - softer intimacy
    - deeper trust
    - emotional turning points
- Still canon to the relationship

These episodes feel like:

> “You’ve reached a side of them not everyone sees.”
> 

---

### 5.4 Special Episodes (Explicitly Non-Canon)

**Purpose**

- Experiments
- Seasonal events
- What-ifs
- Promotional or themed content

**Rules**

- Clearly labeled as non-canon
- Do not affect main progression
- Do not unlock future core episodes

This preserves narrative integrity while allowing creative freedom.

---

## 6. The Episode Ring Model (Integrated)

Each episode operates within **four concentric narrative rings**.

```
┌───────────────────────────────┐
│Ring 4:EmotionalResolution│
├───────────────────────────────┤
│Ring 3:Escalation/Tension│
├───────────────────────────────┤
│Ring 2:Trigger/Complication│
├───────────────────────────────┤
│Ring 1:Situation(ColdOpen)│
└───────────────────────────────┘

```

### Ring Definitions

**Ring 1 — Situation**

- Where are we?
- What’s the immediate context?
- Why now?

**Ring 2 — Trigger**

- What just happened?
- What disrupted equilibrium?

**Ring 3 — Escalation**

- Emotional pressure builds
- Choices matter more
- Subtext intensifies

**Ring 4 — Resolution**

- A shift occurs
- Not an ending — a transformation
- Sets desire for next episode

All episodes must meaningfully engage **at least Rings 1–3**.

Strong episodes touch all four.

---

## 7. Gating Philosophy (Critical)

### Why Episodes Are Gated

Gating exists to:

- create anticipation
- preserve narrative pacing
- prevent emotional dilution
- increase perceived value over time

Gating is **not** punishment or monetization pressure.

> Desire grows when access is structured.
> 

---

### What Gating Is *Not*

- Not artificial scarcity
- Not content withholding
- Not grind mechanics
- Not arbitrary locks

---

## 8. Relationship State Is Implicit

Fantazy does **not** expose “relationship meters” or explicit levels.

Instead:

- relationship state is *felt*
- episodes implicitly advance closeness
- memory and tone shift naturally

This preserves immersion and avoids gamification fatigue.

---

## 9. Episode Count Strategy (Canon Guidance)

### Fixed Numbers Are Discouraged

Do **not** lock characters to a fixed episode count (e.g., “always 3”).

Instead, use **episode bands**:

| Band | Purpose | Typical Count |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Entry | Onboarding | 1 |
| Core Arc | Primary progression | 3–5 |
| Expansion | Depth & longevity | 2–6 |
| Special | Experiments | Optional |

This allows:

- flexible content growth
- character differentiation
- operational scalability

---

## 10. Visual & Narrative Alignment Rule

> The avatar, background, and opening line must all feel like the same moment.
> 

No episode should feel like:

- generic avatar + unrelated text
- static character pasted into a scene

Every episode is treated as a **still frame from a story**.

---

## 11. Replay Philosophy

Replays are allowed but **contextually framed**:

- replaying Episode 0 feels nostalgic
- replaying later episodes feels reflective
- progress is remembered even if replayed

Fantazy prioritizes *continuity over reset*.

---

## 12. Monetization Compatibility (Without Corruption)

This canon supports monetization without breaking immersion:

- early access to episodes
- premium expansion episodes
- special non-canon episodes
- creator-driven premium arcs

Crucially:

> Monetization never bypasses narrative order.
> 

---

## 13. What This Canon Enables Long-Term

With this structure, Fantazy can evolve into:

- a multi-genre episodic platform
- a creator-driven studio ecosystem
- a premium narrative subscription model
- a system with genuine re-engagement loops

All without changing the core philosophy.

---

## 14. Canon Summary (One-Paragraph Lock)

> Fantazy episodes are sequential, emotionally charged narrative moments designed to be earned through engagement. Each episode advances the relationship state, escalates tension, and creates anticipation for what comes next. Episodes are not browsed — they are progressed. This structure prioritizes narrative integrity, emotional momentum, and long-term attachment over content abundance or explicitness.
